# Building Your Challenge

Basically, I just sapwn a Windows 10 VM, created a folder named important and inside it I created a file named secret.txt with the following content:
--> --> Welcome to ATHACKCTF 2k25; ATHACKCTF{NTF$_M4s73r_fiL3_T4bL3!!!} --> Houssem0x1

Then, I extracted the $MFT file using FTK imager.
